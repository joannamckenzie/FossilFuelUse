# FossilFuelUse
What do we actually use fossil fuels for?

# Initial Data Sources

The best source of information I've been able to source online so far has been from the EU Stats page at: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/main/home

In particular I'm using the following two open data sources:
a) Breakdown of petroleum products by year from here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/NRG_BAL_C__custom_1217174/bookmark/table?lang=en&bookmarkId=5e45f2a5-12ab-4050-a112-475c33a6ef93

b) Dependency on oil products by sector from here: 
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/NRG_BAL_C__custom_1209540/bookmark/table?lang=en&bookmarkId=c04fec10-c1e3-4c0f-a0eb-876578716d99

Neither of these datasets will, by themselves allow me to do a sankey diagram of crude oil products to final destinations, which was the goal. However some visualisation of how we use fossil fuels can be done from here.
